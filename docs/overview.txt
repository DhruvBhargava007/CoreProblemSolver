Comprehensive Instructions for Building a Warehouse Problem Solver App (MVP Version)
This document provides a clear, actionable framework for building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) app that automates and tracks warehouse problem-solving, based on your requirements and workflows. The aim is to create a simple, functional solution that can be enhanced based on user feedback.

1. Project Scope and Goals
Goal: Build a simple web app that guides warehouse problem solving, capturing essential requests and steps.
Core Requirements:
- Basic handling of common warehouse problem types
- Simple Excel file output for tracking
- Easy-to-use interface optimized for warehouse environment
- Basic escalation tracking

2. Functional Requirements
2.1. Problem Types and Flows
- Focus on most common problem types initially
- Each type has:
  * Clear description
  * Basic step-by-step guide
  * Simple data collection (scan/enter)
  * Basic escalation option
- General reporting option for uncategorized issues

2.2. Data Tracking and Output
Every problem-solving session creates a simple Excel entry with:
- Problem Type
- Basic Steps Taken
- Key Data Points
- Escalation Status
- Notes

2.3. UI/UX Requirements (Simplified)
- Simple button to open the problem solver
- Clear list of problem types
- Step-by-step wizard interface
- Basic form fields for data entry
- Large, touch-friendly buttons
- High contrast design for warehouse visibility

2.4. Error Handling and Escalation
- Basic error messages
- Simple escalation process
- Capture who was contacted
- Log basic escalation details

2.5. Reporting
- One Excel file per problem type
- Simple structure for easy reading
- Basic filtering capability
- Downloadable files

3. Technical Implementation Guidelines (MVP Version)
Frontend:
- Create React App (simpler than Next.js)
- JavaScript (no TypeScript initially)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Simple component structure

Data Handling:
- xlsx library for Excel operations
- Browser localStorage for temporary data
- Simple state management (React useState/useContext)

Deployment:
- GitHub Pages or Netlify
- Static hosting

File Structure:
/src
  /components
    - ProblemSelector.js
    - StepWizard.js
    - DataEntry.js
    - ExcelExport.js
  /data
    - problemTypes.js
    - escalationContacts.js
  /styles
    - tailwind.css
  App.js
  index.js

4. MVP Features Priority
High Priority:
- Problem type selection
- Basic step-by-step guidance
- Simple data entry
- Excel export
- Basic escalation tracking

Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):
- Advanced error handling
- Complex workflows
- Real-time updates
- Advanced reporting
- User authentication
- Database integration

5. Development Approach
1. Set up basic React project
2. Create core UI components
3. Implement basic problem flows
4. Add Excel export
5. Test in warehouse environment
6. Deploy MVP
7. Gather user feedback

6. Success Metrics
- Successfully log basic problem-solving sessions
- Generate readable Excel outputs
- Complete basic problem-solving workflows
- User can escalate issues when needed

This MVP approach focuses on core functionality while maintaining simplicity and ease of use. Additional features can be added based on user feedback and actual usage patterns.
